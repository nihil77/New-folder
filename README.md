Model Definition: Define your feedforward neural network model. The model architecture, including the number of layers, hidden units, and activation functions, depends on your specific problem. For landmark detection, you might want to use a model that takes the 33 landmarks as input features.

Loss Function: Choose an appropriate loss function for your task. For keypoint detection, Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss is commonly used.

Training: Train your model on the training set using an optimization algorithm (e.g., Adam or SGD) and the chosen loss function. Use the validation set to monitor your model's performance and prevent overfitting.

Evaluation: Evaluate your trained model on the test set to assess its performance. Depending on your task, you can use various evaluation metrics like Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE), Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK), or custom metrics that suit your requirements.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters like the number of hidden layers, the number of hidden units, learning rate, and activation functions to optimize your model's performance.
