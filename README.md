Evaluate the Model: Assess the model's performance using a separate validation dataset. Common evaluation metrics include mean average precision (mAP) and accuracy.

Tune Hyperparameters: Experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) to optimize the model's performance.

Deployment: Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, you can deploy it in your desired application, whether that's a web application, mobile app, or other platforms.

Inference: Use the trained model to perform inference on new images or video frames to detect Horse Stance.
